Loose Structured Data
=====================

Parses strings like:

    `name: Al, grape: "green", 'banana'='not at all'`
    `{value=23.1; 2: átila the hun}`
    `{'ninjá'=23.12a    ; 23=1  ;}`
    `g=true,f:false,l:null;     null    :   false   ,true:23,false:'true' ;`

To sane data. In fact it gives you arrays of key-values, like [['name', 'Al'], ['grape', 'green']], but you can easily turn those into Javascript objects, if you want.

It supports numbers, booleans and null as keys.

See test.js for a better figure of what exactly it does (nothing that it is not said here).
